Solutions for the puzzles of the [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020).

## About this repo
Why did I choose C++? Why did I decide to make it harder for myself by coding in a language I barely know? God knows.

Thing is, I gotta stick to my choice now. Thus, don't expect fancy methods that map or aggregate data, or cool regular expressions that solve everything elegantly and concisely. In this repo, all the code will be basic, ugly and unrefined.
