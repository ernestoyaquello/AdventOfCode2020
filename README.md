# Advent of Code 2020
Solutions in C++ for all the puzzles of the [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020).

## About this repo
Why did I choose C++? Why did I decide to make it harder for myself by coding in a language I just barely know? God knows.

Thing is, I committed to my choice, which helped me turn this event into a learning opportunity. But because of that, the code in this repo cannot be expected to be fancy, elegant or concise; quite the oppositeâ€”even the way the project is set-up makes no sense. On top of that, I wasn't always sure how to solve each problem, so every now and then I ended up applying ugly workarounds in order to get things working.

In any case, the code here works and gives the correct solution for each one of the 50 (25x2) puzzles.
